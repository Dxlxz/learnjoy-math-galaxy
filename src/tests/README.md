# Tests Directory

This directory contains all test files for the Math Mentor application. Tests are organized by feature and follow the same structure as the source code.

## Structure
- `unit/` - Unit tests for individual components and functions
- `integration/` - Integration tests for feature workflows
- `e2e/` - End-to-end tests for complete user journeys

## Naming Convention
Test files should follow the pattern: `[component-name].test.tsx` or `[feature-name].test.tsx`
